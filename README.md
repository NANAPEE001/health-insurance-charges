# Health Insurance Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis & Prediction of Charges

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and machine learning model to predict the charges a person needs to pay for health insurance.
Using a dataset that includes features such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, region, and smoking status, we explore the relationship between these factors and the insurance charges.
The project demonstrates the process of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applying machine learning techniques to predict health insurance charges in R.

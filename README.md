# Health Insurance Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis & Prediction of Charges

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and machine learning model to predict the charges a person needs to pay for health insurance.
Using a dataset that includes features such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, region, and smoking status, we explore the relationship between these factors and the insurance charges. The analysis involves data cleaning, visualization, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling using linear regression, random forests, and decision trees.

This analysis provides insights into the factors influencing health insurance charges and demonstrates various machine learning techniques to predict charges. The results of the statistical tests and machine learning models can help guide decision-making in health insurance pricing
